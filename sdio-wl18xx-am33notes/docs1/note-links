    But something is wrong with the executable iw, the following netlink error occurrs:

    / # iw wlan0 scan
    Failed to allocate generic netlink cache.

    I built the executable iw from the source as described here: 
        http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/WL18xx_WiFi_Build_Process

    I found out that this error was caused by another kernel module making use of 
        netlink multicasts. When I disable this kernel module, iw does not error out anymore.

  Linux/PROCESSOR-SDK-AM335X: Beaglebone Black Wireless WiFi support
    Mar 2, 2018 9:59 PM Munan Xu
    Isaac, I've had success booting the am335x-boneblack-wireless.dtb from 
    the Debian distribution with the latest processor SDK... I haven't fully 
    tested this but wlan0 appears and I can connect to wifi networks.

    It would still be nice to have this dtb officially incorporated into 
    the SDK at some point. Is there a timeline for something like this 
    to happen?
